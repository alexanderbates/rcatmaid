catmaid 0.7.2
=============
* Add catmaid_get_label_stats (use it to find neurons with soma)
* Add copy_tags_connectors (bring over tags/connector info)
* improve summary.catmaidneuron (#78)
* plot3d bugfix when there are NA points (and soma=T) (#77)

catmaid 0.7.1
=============
* only plot soma when explicitly tagged  (rather than plotting a sphere at the 
  root of the neuron if not tagged) (#62)
* only plot3d connectors if they exist (#73)
* Ensure nodes do not normally plot for catmaidneurons  (#74)
* doc fix for catmaid_get_treenode_table (#75)

catmaid 0.7
===========
This is a substantial release with many new functions/enhancements, changes to
match the API defined by the 2016.10.18 CATMAID release, support for token-based
authentication and numerous bug fixes.

* support for CATMAID token-based authentication (#35)
* Add catmaid_get_connectors_between to return connections between (multiple) 
  pre and postsynaptic partners - thanks to Zhihao Zheng (#53, #56)
* Add function to parse CATMAID urls e.g. to extract xyz position (#55)
* Add rename_neuron function (#54)
* Add catmaid_version function (#58)
* Add catmaid_user_history function (#57)
* Add catmaid_get_annotations_for_skeletons function (#38)
* Add catmaid_remove_annotations_for_skeletons function (#43)
* Add catmaid_add_volume to add 3D meshes to catmaid (#69)

* catmaid_get_connector_table can now accept multi skid specifications (#49)
* catmaid_get_connectors_between returns more informative errors (#51)

* fix "No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8." warning (#59)
* stop catmaid_skids returning duplicates when there are multiple matching 
  annotations (#44)
* ensure that connectors are also scaled when xforming neurons (#47)
* catmaid_query_by_annotation returns neuron column as character vector (#46)
* catmaid_get_connector_table returns partner_skid columns as an integer (#48)
* fix bug in url for catmaid_get_review_status function (#45)
* Give sensible name to 1st column of connector data.frame (#42)
* ensure neurons without connectors scale properly (#41)
* fix bug in catmaid_connection_setenv() when some elements are null (#50)
* catmaid_get_annotations_for_skeletons - fix bug in skid order (#39)
* ensure catmaid_get_contributor_stats passes on connection (#37)
* ensure all functions pass on connection to catmaid_fetch (#60)
* connectors.neuronlist should handle neurons without connectors (#29)
* catmaid_skids should pass on pid (#64)
* fix catmaid_get_connector_table to reflect 2016.09.01-65 API change (#65)
* fix bug in catmaid_user_history with small queries (#70)

catmaid 0.6
===========
* support for upcoming httr 1.0 release
* fix: ensure catmaid connection objects are passed to all downstream functions
  e.g. so that you can you use different servers in the same session.
* fix queries that match multiple annotations when using a defined connection
  object
* fix: ensure that catmaid_fetch works even if server does not have a terminal /
  and remote path is also missing a slash
* fix: servers don't have to be https

catmaid 0.5
===========
This release 
* check for http status errors in catmaid (in case there is trouble connecting
  to site, bad URL etc)
* ... and errors in returned JSON when request is invalid
* export funcs to get/set login details as environment variables
* ... and clear those env vars (all useful for testing)

catmaid 0.4
===========
This release significantly enhances functionality for querying for neurons by
annotation or name, while also simplifying a number of plotting/analysis tasks
involving connectors (synapses).

* catmaid_query_by_neuronname was renamed to catmaid_query_by_name (since it can
  query by both neuron or annotation name as well as returning both annotations 
  and neurons)
* read.catmaid.neurons has richer attached metadata 
  (see https://github.com/jefferis/rcatmaid/issues/9)
* read.catmaid.neurons can make simple queries 
  (see https://github.com/jefferis/rcatmaid/issues/9)
* add catmaid_query_by_annotation to fetch objects tagged with a matching 
  annotation (rather than searching by object name).
* add connectors to get connector (synapse) information from a neuron
* add catmaid_catmaid_get_connector_table to see a list of incoming/outgoing
  connections for a given neuron.
* add plot3d.catmaidneuron to enable convenient plotting of synapses
* fix catmaid_get_neuronnames should return names in the same order as passed 
  skids (see https://github.com/jefferis/rcatmaid/issues/6)
* the catmaid skeleton_id is consistently referred to as skid in argument names
  and return values
* depend on nat (and therefore rgl). Import rather than depend on jsonlite.
* minor doc fixes

catmaid 0.3
===========
* cache login credentials for automatic reuse
* option to set/get environment variables for passwords etc
* Add catmaid_query_connected, catmaid_get_annotationlist, catmaid_query_by_neuronname
* low level catmaid_fetch function covers GET and POST requests
