catmaid 0.5
===========
This release 
* check for http status errors in catmaid (in case there is trouble connecting
  to site, bad URL etc)
* ... and errors in returned JSON when request is invalid
* export funcs to get/set login details as environment variables
* ... and clear those env vars (all useful for testing)

catmaid 0.4
===========
This release significantly enhances functionality for querying for neurons by
annotation or name, while also simplifying a number of plotting/analysis tasks
involving connectors (synapses).

* catmaid_query_by_neuronname was renamed to catmaid_query_by_name (since it can
  query by both neuron or annotation name as well as returning both annotations 
  and neurons)
* read.catmaid.neurons has richer attached metadata 
  (see https://github.com/jefferis/rcatmaid/issues/9)
* read.catmaid.neurons can make simple queries 
  (see https://github.com/jefferis/rcatmaid/issues/9)
* add catmaid_query_by_annotation to fetch objects tagged with a matching 
  annotation (rather than searching by object name).
* add connectors to get connector (synapse) information from a neuron
* add catmaid_catmaid_get_connector_table to see a list of incoming/outgoing
  connections for a given neuron.
* add plot3d.catmaidneuron to enable convenient plotting of synapses
* fix catmaid_get_neuronnames should return names in the same order as passed 
  skids (see https://github.com/jefferis/rcatmaid/issues/6)
* the catmaid skeleton_id is consistently referred to as skid in argument names
  and return values
* depend on nat (and therefore rgl). Import rather than depend on jsonlite.
* minor doc fixes

catmaid 0.3
===========
* cache login credentials for automatic reuse
* option to set/get environment variables for passwords etc
* Add catmaid_query_connected, catmaid_get_annotationlist, catmaid_query_by_neuronname
* low level catmaid_fetch function covers GET and POST requests
